## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned when to use flexbox or to use the position property for positioning. I also learned how to use CSS custom properties.

### Continued development

In my upcoming projects, I want to learn how I can improve my code by making it clean and efficient.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This website helped me understand some CSS concepts better. The explanation was really clear I will keep using this resource in the future.
